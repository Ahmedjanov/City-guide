Anyone passing the path from Bishkek to Issyk-Kul passes into the Boom Gorge.  There is simply no other way, except for wild hiking trails, through the Tien Shan mountains.  Boom is a long narrow canyon, along the bottom of which flows the fast mountain river Chu.  The picturesque place is added by Soviet statues of an eagle, a pioneer, a leopard and a deer, located along the highway, as well as a memorial to those who died in the 1916 uprising.
