On the southern coast of Issyk-Kul, near the village of Tamga, there is a gorge of the same name.  Every kilometer there are stones with embossed Tibetan-Buddhist prayers of the VIII-IX centuries.  Local legends attribute the authorship of the inscriptions to the ancient warriors, however, according to scientists, they were left by Buddhist pilgrims.  The word "tamga" itself comes from the Turkic language and means "seal" or "brand".  A maximum of impressions can be obtained during an equestrian tour of the gorge, but this method of exploring the surroundings is not suitable for everyone.
