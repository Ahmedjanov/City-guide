Karakol Gorge is located 9 kilometers south of the city.  At the foot of the mountains in the summer there is a climbing camp, from where professionals climb the peaks of Dzhigit, Gastello, Przhevalsky.  Even unprepared tourists need only a couple of hours of climbing to see with their own eyes how the steppe belt is replaced by alpine meadows and snow.  The Karakol river flows along the bottom of the gorge, its tributaries form the On-Tor and Sharkyrtma waterfalls.  At the source of the river there are seven glacial lakes, including the vast, crystal clear Ala-Kul and the mysterious Merzbacher Lake, which disappears completely once a year during the melting of the glaciers.  The river valley is considered a national park, they can charge a fee for entering some trails.  The park is allowed to conduct licensed hunting for animals.
