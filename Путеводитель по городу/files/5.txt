Erkindik Gallery is called the "Bishkek Arbat".  Here, local artists and artisans put up for sale their work.  As on the real Arbat, here you can buy all kinds of souvenirs, but you must be prepared to overpay for them several times.  You don’t need to specifically look for the Erkindik gallery - it is located just between Oak Park and Ala To Square, in the very center of Bishkek.
