There are no problems with standing in Kyrgyzstan: in cities there are many hotels, in villages there are private rooms and "villas" at affordable prices.  And if you book accommodation, then only for the first time, especially in the capital.  But there is nothing to do more than a couple of days in Bishkek.  We need to leave for the mountains, to the shores of Issyk-Kul, in Osh and all the way to the south.  And in the province, in terms of housing, it is more profitable to rely on the case and the advice of local residents.  If you look for housing through travel agencies, then it makes sense to look at those that are members of the Kyrgyz ToS Association (there are branches in all large settlements).  Tos stands for "community-based tourism."  This is a globally promoted area aimed at preserving native cultures and the environment.  Kyrgyz companies operating according to the CBT principles are intermediaries between local residents and tourists.  They help to settle in the villages and even yurts of real nomads in the alpine meadows of jailoo, arrange walking and horseback riding tours, throw them to the right points and simply share information.  At the same time, most of the profit goes to the receiving side, that is, to local residents, which allows them to maintain their lifestyle.Since the main attraction of Kyrgyzstan is the virgin nature, divided between parks, reserves and biosphere reserves, it is worth taking a tent on a trip.  Or rent it, handing things in the luggage room of one of the campsites and going on a hiking trip, say, along the Arashan gorge or the Karakol valley.
