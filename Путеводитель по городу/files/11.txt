The Museum of Art (formerly Kyrgyz National Art Gallery) was opened in 1935.  The collection of the museum includes canvases transferred from the Hermitage and the Tretyakov Gallery.  In total, the museum houses about 17 thousand exhibits - from socialist paintings by local artists to works of decorative art, such as embroidery, wood carving, leather embossing, and, of course, traditional Kyrgyz felt products.
