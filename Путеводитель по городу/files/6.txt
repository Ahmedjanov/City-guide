The resort is open all year.  In winter, lovers of alpine skiing, snowboarding and sledding come here: ride and sunbathe at the same time.  The system of tracks is long, but not particularly difficult.  The lifts reach somewhere up to half the height, then the untreated slopes, where they can be reached by snowmobile taxis.  In summer, the company organizes trekking, climbing, horseback riding and fishing.  You can stay at a local hotel or chalet.
