The National Philharmonic is named after akyn Toktogul Satylganov.  These are two concert halls with more than a thousand seats (the philharmonic society moved to the new building in 1980), where both local groups and touring stars perform from the troupes of the Moscow Bolshoi Theater or the Moscow Art Theater to colloquial artists like Evgeny Petrosyan or Gennady Khazanov.  All kinds of corporate events, state celebrations and festivals are held here.
