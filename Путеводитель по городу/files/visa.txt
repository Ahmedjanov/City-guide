Do I need a visa?  Russians do not need a visa to Kyrgyzstan to visit this country.  At the border, it is enough to present a passport or Russian passport.  At the border, a stamp is placed in the passport or, when crossing the border with a Russian passport, with a special migration card.  This is the visa to Kyrgyzstan for the Russians.  Please note that the absence of a stamp in the passport or migration card can lead to problems when leaving Kyrgyzstan or in the case of checking documents within the country (the latter is a common occurrence, so it is better to carry documents with you).  When entering Kyrgyzstan with children, a child’s birth certificate must be presented;  child’s passport or internal passport or passport of the parent in which the child is registered.  If the child enters the country accompanied by one of the parents or third parties, a notarized power of attorney from the parent (s) is required for the child’s export from Russia.
