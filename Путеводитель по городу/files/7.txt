10 km from Karakol in the gorge and valley of the Arashan River, near the village of Ak-Suu there are hot springs.  All that remains of the Soviet resort is a few houses where you can spend the night for a moderate fee, and concrete bathrooms inside wooden sheds, which are also allowed for money.  The water in the source is slightly radon, the temperature is about 50 degrees.  The place is extremely picturesque, however, like any corner of Kyrgyzstan.
