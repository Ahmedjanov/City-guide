Variegated juniper covered the local mountains and gave the general name of the place - “Ala-Archa”.  The territory of the park is completely occupied by a mountain gorge with Ak-Sai waterfall at an altitude of 2800 meters, the Chu River at the bottom and ice caps frozen somewhere very high.  You can come here for a day or more, on your own or in an organized local tour.  Trusting trufirm and local guides is primarily because they know where to walk and enjoy the views safely.  Along the slopes there are trails of various difficulty levels, including “professional” ones, to the peaks of Semenov-Tyanshansky, Korona and Teacher.  At an altitude of 2150 meters, among the fir trees, the alpine camp remaining from Soviet times is covered.  There you can spend the night for little money.
