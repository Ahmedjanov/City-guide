The once vast crown of the Kyrgyz railway has now shrunk to several branches.  The main one leads from Russia and Kazakhstan to Bishkek, and from Bishkek to Balykchi.  In fact, they reach Balykchi, the first resort on the way to the lake, by minibuses and taxis.  So it’s real that the railway in the capital “breaks off”, spitting out passengers at bus stations.  As for the remaining branches, some sections of the southern railway branch (Osh, Karasu, Jalal-Abad, etc.) are engaged only in freight traffic.  The Ministry of Transport of the country raised the issue of building a railway from China to Uzbekistan, which will be decided, judging by how the construction of the "Trans-Kyrgyz Railway" froze, not soon.  Train timetables and ticket prices Bus is the main means of transportation around the country, prices are moderate even for local ones.  Cases half a century ago are clogged with people and bales to failure so that many sit on boards between rows or simply on the floor.  The windows are open, the hatches are raised, the curtains drawn from the sun fly apart, letting in the mountain wind and dizzying views.  The main thing is not to look down: at the next pass, the bus tilts so that the road is not visible, but only an abyss under it.Minibuses are more expensive.  With taxi drivers need to bargain.  For a lot of money, they will bring them faster, and also stop at the request of all the stone animals from the Soviet "decorations" of the Boom Gorge.  Ready for bribery, Kazakhs and Russians come in their own cars.  We recommend the Article "International driver's license" Article "The ABC of car travel"
