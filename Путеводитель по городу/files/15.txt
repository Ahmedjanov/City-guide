It is known that salt can cure a number of diseases, including allergies, neuroses, and bronchial asthma.  In 1980, a sanatorium for 120 people was organized in one of the parts of the Chon-Tuz salt mine near the village of Kochkorka in the south-west of the Kochkor district of the Naryn region of Kyrgyzstan.  The underground room of the sanatorium is a gallery with a length of 500 m, a height of 3 and a width of 5. Chambers with beds depart from it, windows, of course, no.  The therapeutic effect is achieved by an increased content of microcrystals of salt in the air and a reduced number of bacteria in it.  The air temperature is below 10 degrees, so visitors, in addition to the medical direction, it is important to bring warm clothes.  The course of treatment is 16 days.
