Huge and deserted, Ala-Too Square is considered the heart of the city.  Several years ago, it was reconstructed, covered with patterns of flower beds, and the fountain was renovated.  Along the perimeter there are traditional tourist places - the State Historical Museum, the monument of Friendship of Peoples, Oak Park with the Open-Air Sculpture Museum and the oldest building in the city - St. Nicholas Church.  It is interesting that Lenin was removed from the central place only in 2003, replacing him with the winged woman Erkendik, which means "Freedom."  At her feet on the plates are laid out words translated as “Noble thoughts, truthful words, righteous deeds.”  Ironically, the manifestations of freedom were not long in coming.  After 2005, Ala-Too became the main venue for anti-government rallies.  All kinds of festivities take place here.
