The canyons are 1.5-2 million years old.  They stretch for 200 kilometers and are a series of wind-blown columns from 300 to 500 meters high.  The pillars, in turn, make up a labyrinth in which the outlines of a strange city, a Martian, are guessed, judging by the color of the exposed rock.  Hence the name “Bobsleigh”, “Rock Castles”.  It is curious that in Suluu-Terek there is almost no rainfall, vegetation and it is very hot.  A walk is worth a few days, no less.  “Skyscraper”, Canyons begin an hour walk from the “red” railway bridge over the Chu River in the Boom Gorge, near the village of Kok-Moinok.  You need to get with local guides, otherwise there is a great risk of getting lost or just choosing the wrong route.
