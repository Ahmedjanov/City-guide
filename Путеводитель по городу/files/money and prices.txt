The local currency - som (S, KGS) - is equal to 100 tyiyins.  Money changes everywhere, but the cost of the ruble in the province is lower than in Bishkek.  For payment, often unofficially accept rubles and dollars, while mercilessly underestimating the rate.  The Kyrgyz “set of traveler” mobile communications, food, accommodation and transport - despite the increase in prices, it still costs a penny, especially if you do not use the services of travel agencies-intermediaries.  Room rental - from $ 10, food from a dollar per dish (an average of $ 5-6 per visit), a bus ride from Bishkek to Karakol (10 hours) - about 150 rubles.
