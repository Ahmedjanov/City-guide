Felt crafts of various kinds are brought from Kyrgyzstan - toys, hats, slippers, bags, carpets.  You can buy a quilt-zhurkan or an authentic horse harness.  Koumiss will be used as an edible souvenir, or its “chewing” counterpart, kurut.  Many take away from Kyrgyzstan heavy cast-iron cauldrons for pilaf and even real yurts - from 5 thousand dollars apiece.
