The Burana Tower is the minaret of the destroyed Jami Mosque, destroyed during the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars in the 13th century.  Pal and the city of Balasagun surrounding it - the capital of the medieval Khanhanid Haganate.  Now the settlement has been excavated and the whole place has been turned into an archaeological and architectural open-air museum.  In fact, except for the tower, almost nothing stands out from the ground, and therefore its appearance is impressive.  Imagine a lonely, powerful perfectly preserved pipe against a completely flat landscape.  By the way, you can climb onto it.  The architectural complex is also good because it brought stone sculptures from the ancient Turkic burial grounds of the Chui, Kemin and Issyk-Kul valleys of the 6th-10th centuries.
