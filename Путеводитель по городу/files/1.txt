Dordoi is considered to be the largest clothing market in Central Asia.  This is a miniature two-story city with its streets and areas: Muras-Sport, Oberon-Fort, Carben-South, Europe, etc. Instead of tent-containers of incomprehensible factory origin.  Between them scammers, sellers of street food, Bishkek residents in search of cheap clothes and equipment, as well as pocket thieves.  Just like that, Western tourists go here, for whom what is happening on the market is truly exotic.  To walk along the Dordoi was remembered as a pleasant adventure, you should dress more modestly and forget valuable things and money at home.
