When the weather in Kyrgyzstan is heterogeneous due to the rich topography and the lack of stabilizing influence of the sea.  So, in the winter in the mountains the temperature drops to -30, while in the flat areas it is quite warm, only -3.  In the summer, the mountains are cool, the thermometer does not climb above 10. At the same time, urban residents suffer from 40-degree heat.  However, “suffer” - it is said loudly.  The locals have long developed a life-saving arsenal of habits - to wrap themselves in clothes in the sun, drink hot tea instead of cold water in the heat, get up at dawn and go to the siesta during the day.  An ideal place for weather conditions is the shore of Issyk-Kul: 25-30 degrees in the summer and about 2 in the winter.  The most pleasant thing in the republic is from May to September, in July-August the resorts are especially crowded.
